# Tide Academy 2023
Welcome to the Tide Academy, where innovation and learning collide to create the next generation of the internet!

We believe that the future is in knowledge, and are committed to educating the next generation of developers about the potential of locking down platforms with keys no one will ever hold - introducing unprecedented security, privacy and self sovereignty. Our dedicated instructors will guide you through a set of courses that covers everything from the basics of decentralization to the practical applications of Tide's technology. You'll learn about the latest research, explore real-world case studies, and participate in hands-on projects that will prepare you for deploying secure products in spite of rapidly-growing cyber-threats.

Join us at the Tide Academy and be a part of the solution for a better tomorrow. Together, we can harness the power of Tide and create a safer, more accessible world for all.
