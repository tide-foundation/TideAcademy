# Final Assessment 
## Task Outline
Create an application that implements the Heimdall Javascript SDK that either improves the security of your application OR reduces the damage of a breach e.g. user passwords are encrypted with a key your application's servers have no access to.

Your application could be anything, as long as it uses some Javascript to implement the SDK.

Your application could be:
- A SPA (Single Page Application)
- A website that uses a back-end
- A console application

You will also need to provide a short explanation of
- ***why*** your solution required Tide
- ***how*** you improved your application's security with Tide OR ***how*** you reduced the damage of a breach in your application
